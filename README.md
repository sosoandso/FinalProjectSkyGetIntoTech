# FinalProjectSkyGetIntoTech
Sky Get Into Tech 15 week program Final Project.

Our final project was created in the last 3 weeks of the course.

Project LISA.
 
The name LISA originates from our names: Livi, Ikraan, Seyram and Alice.

We decided to create this brand/ website to support employees and visitors of Sky; to expose them to great services outside working hours.

This project was to help people have a cosier transition of getting back into the office since Covid and also support local businesses in the area.
